# People-Tracking-and-Counting
This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm combined with the ByteTrack multi-object tracking algorithm to monitor and count people passing a specified marker. The direction of movement (right-to-left or left-to-right) is recorded, and counters are incremented accordingly.
